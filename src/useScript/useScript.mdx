Dynamically load an external script in one line with this React hook. This can be useful to integrate a third party library like Google Analytics or Stripe.

This avoids loading this script in the `<head> </head>` on all your pages if it is not necessary.

Optionally you can pass an object of options as the second parameter:

- `shouldPreventLoad` can conditionally prevent a script from rendering
- `removeOnUnmount` will remove the created script from the DOM when the calling component unmounts
